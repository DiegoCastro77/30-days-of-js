# 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge

Welcome to the 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge repository! This repository is created to document my journey through the 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge, where I will be completing daily coding exercises and sharing my progress.

## About the Challenge

The 30 Days of JavaScript Challenge is a programming challenge designed to help developers improve their JavaScript skills by completing a series of coding exercises. Each day, I'll be working on a new JavaScript exercise, covering various topics such as variables, functions, arrays, objects, DOM manipulation, asynchronous JavaScript, and more.
